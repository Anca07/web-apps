            <p>Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt
                Bellamy
                (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic
                Howard
                (drums).</p>
            <p>Described as an alternative rock, space rock and progressive rock band, Muse mix sounds from genres such
                as electronic music, progressive metal and art rock, and forms such as classical music, rock opera and
                many others.</p>
            <p>Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social
                alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their
                hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing
                issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology..</p>

                            themes reflect the band's interest in science fiction. The album charted at number one in
